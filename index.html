          <h4>Arthur Wright, South Coast Track February 2017</h4>
          I have just walked the stunningly wild and unspoiled South Coast Track
          in Tasmania with the company Trek Tasmania in February/March of this
          year. I chose them because I had enjoyed their sister company, Trek
          Larapinta, which I had used for a fantastic 16-day walk on the
          Larapinta Trail out of Alice Springs in August 2016 (In fact, I
          wondered whether I was physically capable of doing the South Coast
          Track so I had asked one of my Larapinta guides at the end of that
          hike who, having assessed me—carrying just a light pack—over 260 km,
          said that I would be up to the South Coast Track). This 9-day full
          pack hike was challenging (so I did a lot of training, especially with
          a full pack) but thoroughly enjoyable because of the meticulous
          planning by the company but, above all, because of the quality of our
          guides. Both Jacob and Kenna are Tasmanians and they have an intimate
          knowledge of their “backyard” and an enormous pride in the wild parts
          of Tasmania. They have really good people skills and are very
          encouraging, making sure that everybody enjoys the walk. When problems
          arose—blisters? Mostly prevented through good advice, but when some
          popped up, they were quickly patched and pain-free from then on.
          Medical emergency? Out comes the satellite phone, and advice is
          received and acted on. Crisis averted. And, like the guides on the
          Larapinta, they are fantastic cooks—although on the South Coast Track
          they lacked the Larapinta luxuries of refrigeration and camp
          ovens—they were still able to turn out tasty, nutritious and
          energy-filled meals using very simple equipment. And the coffee they
          made every morning I can honestly say is some of the best I’ve ever
          had. Jacob and Kenna carried very large (and heavy) packs and that
          made our lives a lot easier, even though our packs were fairly heavy.
          The guides gave us clear briefings of what to expect—what the terrain
          would be like, how much water to carry, how to preserve the
          environment. Highly recommended.

          <h4>Glynis A, Kakadu Explorer August 2016</h4>
          I am writing to let you know that I had a wonderful time on the Kakadu
          trip. I thought that things could not be better after Larapinta end to
          end with the fantastic Cat and Joel but it did! Josh, Steve and Jo
          were the Dream Team. Josh was such a good guide, often stopping to
          tell us about a cave, a wall, a rock with art that we would see just
          ahead, a bird flying overhead or a plant at our feet, cooking us
          delicious meals every evening and just being so knowledgeable and
          enthusiastic always. Steve was always happy to offer his hand to guide
          me through some of the more difficult stages and was also a mind of
          information about what we encountered along the way, fantastic. And
          Jo, she was also a helping hand when needed with a happy smile at
          every stage, her breakkie porridge was wonderful. Such a brilliant
          team that worked so hard to ensure we had a wonderful trip and they
          worked so well together – make sure you keep them, they were the added
          bonus and were the cherry on top of the Kakadu cake. Brilliant. The
          hike was hard, no doubt about that and I feel that all 3 of the guides
          in their own way, brought that little extra something to the trip.
          More of the same please! Please tell them that they made the trip
          extra special and thank them for their hard work and dedication, it
          will never be forgotten. Thank you Trek Tours.

            Alison Anderson and Lyndal Worsfold, Larapinta Trail Super 6 Day
            Trek August 2016
          </h4>
          We have just completed the Super 6 Day Larapinta Trek with Trek
          Larapinta and it exceeded all expectations! Five years in the planning
          we expected beautiful scenery, but weren’t quite prepared for the
          scale and just how breathtaking it actually is! The trek turned out to
          be about much more than the scenery. Our guides, Kate and Rob, are
          experts and an asset to Trek Larapinta. They are very knowledgeable
          about the geology, flora and fauna of the area and their enthusiasm
          for sharing the Larapinta with others was inspiring. An added bonus
          was their superb cooking skills. The fresh, wholesome and extremely
          yummy food was much appreciated! There were many other highlights;
          from our fellow trekkers who became firm friends, campfire chats,
          sleeping under the stars in a swag, very refreshing swims in Birthday
          Waterhole and the Finke River, a show-off Spinifex Pigeon, to
          challenging but fun walking. Loved the rock hopping in the gorges! The
          NT Parks trail builders who constructed all the rock stairs on the
          slopes are to be commended. We have no hesitation in recommending Trek
          Larapinta and hope we can join another Trek Australia tour soon!
